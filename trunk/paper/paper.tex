\begin{abstract}

With the success of Web technologies, people are seeking similar experiences gleaned from other domains to be applied to web navigation. Based on this trend, we can envision an application using Web browser to navigate information on a big display in the home environment. Webnnel is an implementation of a Web navigation system to represent web sites as TV channels and allow users to use multi-modalities to control navigation. Currently, Webnnel contains three input modalities to demonstrate the interactive behaviors, including speech recognizer, (mouse) gesture and keyboard input. Furthermore, Webnnel’s architecture is flexible to connect with other kinds of input modalities to provide better interaction on Web navigation.

\section{Introduction}

Before the era of the Web, people used to use specific software to satisfy the need. However, the Web has become an important medium for delivering information nowadays. There are more and more people relying on it for work and entertainment, such as checking e-mails, reading news, watching videos, listening to music and shopping on the Web. Users even seem to have their free operating system on the Web [13,14].In this paper, we envision a future application to use Web browser on a big screen TV in the home environment. We have designed a Web navigation system to represent web sites as TV channels and allow users to use multiple modalities to navigate them, even to control and change the content of the web sites. In short, the user can use the input modalities to send out the request to the system, and the system would respond correspondingly. (Figure 1)

\section{Background on the Creative Commons}

Creative Commons (CC), has tried to answer questions pertaining to the promotion of reasonable and flexible copyright regime for the World Wide Web for several years now. One of the widely accepted solutions so far has been
to create licenses that permit sharing and reuse with conditions, clearly communicated in human readable form. The other option is to leverage digital networks themselves to make licensed work more reusable and  \cite{hal08cc}

\section{Motivating Scenario}

User Study - Harvest Some URIs and run the system over with all those

Focus this more as a validator

Science Commons work, where people have so many different sources, and they might want to run their own work on the validator to see any license violations of works.

Alice is an avid Flickr user and she uploads her photos to her account regularly. In her Flickr account settings she has applied "CC-BY-3.0" to all her photos by default. This means she allows anybody to 
Bob sees one of her photos which interest him, and he 
embeds the photo in his 

\section{Related Work}

DRM - Joan Feiganbaum's work


Much of the work that has been done in this area includes incorporating the CC license along with the meta data for an image. LibLicense ~/cite{liblicense} provides a low-level license metadata integration for applications. 

XMP

\section{System Design}

Use of the AIR reasoner for more complicated license scenarios like original work licensed under CC-BY-SA being licensed with ACM license and CC-BY.

\begin{figure*}[h]
  \centerline{\epsfig{file=images/design.jpg,  width=1\linewidth}}
  \caption{System Design}
  \label{fig-design}
\end{figure*}

This system has 4 major components.

The crawler will look at a given site and determine if there are any embedded Flickr photos.
If such photos are detected, License Checker will determine whether it is under a Creative Commons license.
The User Checker will find out other identifying information related to the original creator of the photo. Since all Creative Commons licensed works should give attribution to the original creator, the crawler will again check whether the name or any other identifying information of the original creator appears on the page the photo is embedded on.
The notifier will send a notification to the original creator about the data usage and license terms violation.

The crawler implements a basic BFS algorithm to check for Flickr image URIs in a given site.

A Flickr image URI takes one of the following formats:

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\epsfig{file=images/uri_format.png,  width=1\linewidth}}
  \caption{Format of Flickr Image URIs}
  \label{fig-flickr}
\end{figure}


From the photo URI, the id of the photo can be extracted. Using this id, all the information related to the photo could be obtained by calling several methods in the Flickr API. This information also includes the original creator's Flickr user account, name and CC license information pertaining to the photo. Again, using the crawler, the page is checked to see whether the original creator is attributed (only if the photo has a CC license attached). With the QDOS SPARQL endpoint, more of the photo owner's data (FOAF URI, etc) could be obtained, to perform a thorough search and notify in case of a license terms violation.


\section{Applicability to other types of Licenses}
\cite{berners08n3}

\section{Issues}

This will not work if the images are downloaded from Flickr and embedded in the site.
Can write license information as EXIF data, but it could be easily overwritten
BFS is only limited to all the links within the seed site
Locality of the search for creator within the web page should be improved
Notification to user for any license terms violation is not implemented. Needs user consent and worry about DPAs, etc.

\section{Future Work}

Extend to other CC licenses
Extend to other data usage scenarios (for e.g. YouTube)
Track provenance of images using metadata (instead of relying on the URIs)
Social Verification: i.e. use the FOAF graph to control access for viewing, tagging and commenting on photo sharing sites
Automatically inject the attribution details whenever a photo is linked
